# DrivEze Car Rental app

  This is my capstone project for my coding bootcamp called "DrivEze" - a mockup car rental website that allows users to register, select vehicles to rent from various hubs, update their profile details, view the entire inventory, add items to a persistent cart with a total price, and checkout using dummy credit card data. The project also includes an "About Us" section with company information and basic features such as a logout button. Through this project, I gained experience in full-stack development, UI design, and database management, working on a team and problem-solving.
